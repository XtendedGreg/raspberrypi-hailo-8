# **Real-Time AI on a Raspberry Pi 5 with the Hailo-8 Accelerator**

\!

This repository contains the resources for a presentation and report on how to supercharge a Raspberry Pi 5 with a dedicated AI coprocessor, enabling incredible performance for real-time artificial intelligence projects.

### **What is This All About?**

This project explores combining the popular **Raspberry Pi 5** with the **Hailo-8 AI Accelerator**, a specialized M.2 chip built to run AI models at incredible speeds.

Normally, running complex AI tasks on a small computer like a Raspberry Pi would slow its main processor (the CPU) to a crawl. By offloading the AI work to the Hailo-8, the Pi's CPU is freed up, allowing you to run powerful, real-time AI applications that are:

* **Fast:** Get data-center-level performance (up to 26 Trillion Operations Per Second) for tasks like real-time object detection in video streams.  
* **Private:** All processing happens on your device. No need to send sensitive data like video feeds to the cloud.  
* **Efficient:** The Hailo-8 chip is extremely power-efficient, making it perfect for robotics and other battery-powered projects.  
* **Reliable:** Your AI applications will work perfectly even without an internet connection.

This whole concept is known as **"Edge AI."**

### **What's in This Repository?**

1. **hailo\_presentation.html**: An HTML slideshow that provides a high-level overview of the technology, its benefits, real-world applications, and a simple setup guide. You can open this file in any web browser to view the presentation.  
2. **hailo\_pi5\_report.md**: A detailed technical report that dives deeper into the hardware, performance metrics, and software implementation. It includes full references and is perfect for anyone who wants to understand the technical details.

### **How to Get Started (The Easy Way)**

One of the best parts about this setup is how easy the software installation has become. Thanks to a partnership between Raspberry Pi and Hailo, everything you need is included in the standard Raspberry Pi OS.

To install all the necessary drivers and tools, just run these commands on your Pi 5:

\# First, make sure your system is up to date  
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade \-y

\# Install all Hailo software with one command  
sudo apt install \-y hailo-all

\# Reboot to load the new drivers  
sudo reboot

After that, you're ready to run powerful AI applications\! For example code, check out Hailo's official app repository: [https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-apps](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-apps)

We hope you find these resources useful for starting your own high-performance Edge AI projects\!
